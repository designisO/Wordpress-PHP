# Learning PHP for WordPress

In this repo I am reviewing PHP for WordPress.

PHP : Pulls data from the database to the site. Server side scripting and programming language.
MySQL: is where all the data, pw and more are stored. 
Wordpress: is the CMS that we will use. It uses PHP to take fetch data from the database to the website itself.
WP Rest API : Uses JS to interact with the database.
PHP Coding Standards: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/

Chapter 3: First Steps with PHP
	- template commenting
	- functions of php
